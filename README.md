The amount you should ask for depends on several factors, including the complexity of the project, your experience, and market rates. Since you're working on **arbitrage bot integration** (which involves API integration, live trading, error handling, and thorough testing), this is a moderately complex project. Here's a rough breakdown to help you set your price:

### Considerations:
1. **Project Complexity**: 
   - Integration of both frontend and backend.
   - CEX and DEX API integration (Binance, other exchanges).
   - Real-time trading, handling of arbitrage opportunities.
   - Error handling and security (API keys, transaction management).

2. **Time Estimate**: 
   - **1â€“2 weeks** for completion based on the remaining work (assuming full-time dedication).

3. **Market Rates**:
   - For a developer with experience in API integrations, arbitrage bots, and trading automation, the typical hourly rate could range from **$50 to $150 per hour**.
   - If you estimate the project will take **40-80 hours** to complete, the total could range from:
     - **$2,000 to $12,000**.

### Pricing Breakdown:
- **Hourly Rate**: If you charge by the hour, a fair range would be **$50 to $100/hour**, depending on your experience and the region you're working in.
- **Fixed Price**: If you prefer a fixed price, consider the complexity and time estimate to determine a fair range. For this type of project, a fixed rate of **$3,000 to $10,000** could be reasonable.

If you're unsure, start by discussing the scope with the client and adjust based on your level of expertise and how well-defined the project is. Make sure to include buffer time for any unforeseen issues or additional requests.
